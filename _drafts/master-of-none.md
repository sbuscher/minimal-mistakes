* As IT swallows GIS, geospatial developers must become even more versatile full stack devs.  
* Expectation is that you know DB, Services, Front end plus Cloud (AWS), AGS, Portal and so on  
* With areas becoming so much more complex will it even be possible to keep up as a geospatial full stack developer?  
* Look at my learning goals for example:  
    * AngularJS (4)  
    * Nodejs  
    * Portal  
    * Python data science  
    * etc  
* Who can keep up?
