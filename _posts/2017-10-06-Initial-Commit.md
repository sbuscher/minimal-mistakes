With many failed blog initiatives under my belt, it's time to get over the mountain. I've played with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) platforms in the past and was never satisfied. Wordpress comes across as a giant kitchen sink that's long in the tooth. Tumblr microblogging was just too micro. I originally didn't take the time to understand Jekyll and themes were lacking.  

Well I've come full circle back to Jekyll. The reasoning:    
* A fantastic [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.  
* Ability to host directly from a GitHub repo via [GitHubPages](https://pages.github.com/). 
* Support for writing posts in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), especially nice for code samples.  
* Jekyll does more than blogs, it's a static site generator. I wanted the ability to create a web site with an integrated blog.  

I'm a minimalist so there's not much to this site as of now. However, I'll be adding CV and project showcase pages in time and tidy things up a bit. 

:wq
